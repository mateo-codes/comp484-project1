                    <h2>What are Progressions?</h2>
                    <p class="indent">
                        In calisthenics, progressions are step by step ways to make an exercise harder (or easier)
                        while keeping good form. Instead of just adding weight, you can also increase difficulty through leverage,
                        the range of motion, slowing down, and maintaining control.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        The goal is to master each step before moving on. Clean reps and full control matter more
                        than rushing to advanced movements. You'll just end up getting hurt and have to stop training while you heal.

                    <ul class="indent">
                        <li><strong>Control first:</strong> If you can't control the movement, it's too advanced.</li>
                        <li><strong>Full range of motion:</strong> Use a range you can own with good form.</li>
                        <li><strong>Progress gradually:</strong> Add difficulty in small steps. The last thing you want is to get hurt.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quality over quantity:</strong> Stop sets before form breaks down.</li>

                    <p class="indent">
                        Skills are what make calisthenics both exciting and <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> frustrating. I would suggest picking one skill to practice 3-4 times per week
                        before your workout for about 30 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">Some examples include</p>
                    <ul class="indent">
                        <li><strong>Handstands:</strong> 80% balance, 20% strength</li>
                        <li><strong>Muscle ups:</strong> Explosive pull ups + straight bar dips + transitional drills</li>
                        <li><strong>Front Lever:</strong> Need a strong back honey</li>
                        <li><strong>Planche:</strong> Can quite literally take years to learn</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="indent">
                        While learning some of these skills it's important to remember that it can take several years to learn some of these skills.
                        It ultimately depends on how hard and consistently you are at practicing it. While it can be frustrating, 
                        it's really important to not get discouraged and learn how to enjoy the process. Calisthenics is quite literally a journey, 
                        there's alot more to it than just working out and getting strong. It can teach you how to stay disciplined 
                        and what it means to show up for yourself everyday. 
                    </p>
                    <p> On our <a href="mindset.html">mindset page</a> we take a deeper look into how calisthenics is not only about functional strength, 
                        but also how it can improve other areas of your life outside of the gym. The most important thing of course is to never give up.
