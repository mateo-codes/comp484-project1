                    <p class="indent">
                        Before moving onto learn more complex skills like muscle ups or handstands, it is essential
                        to develop a strong foundation in the core movements. These fundamental exercises
                        train the entire body and prepare your muscles, joints, and nervous system
                        for more advanced progressions.

                    <h2>Why Fundamentals Matter</h2>
                    <p class="indent">
                        Mastering the basics ensures proper form, reduces injury risk, and builds the
                        strength required for advanced skills. Many beginners rush into advanced movements,
                        but long term progress comes from consistent practice of the fundamentals.
                    </p>

                    <p class="indent">
                        Focusing on clean reps, controlled tempo, and a full range of motion.
                        Strength built slowly and correctly will last a lifetime.

                    <h2>Beginner Starter Routine</h2>
                    <ol class="indent">
                        <li>Chest: Standard push ups - 3 sets of 8-12 reps</li>
                        <li>Shoulders: Pike pushups - 3 sets of 8-12 reps </li>
                        <li>Triceps: Dips - 3 sets of 10-15 reps</li>
                        <li>Legs: Bodyweight Squats - 3 sets of 12-15 reps</li>
                        <li>Back: Pull-ups or Assisted Pull-ups - 3 sets of 5-8 reps</li>
                        <li>Core: Hollow Body Hold - 2 sets of 30-60 seconds
                            <br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hanging leg raises - 3 sets till failure
                            <br>

                    <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                    <p class="indent">
                        Once you can complete all sets with clean form and full control,
                        it's time to begin progressing your movements. In calisthenics,
                        progress comes from increasing difficulty and not just adding reps.
                    </p>

                    <p class="indent">
                        This may mean trying other forms or push ups, adding weight to your dips, even going from 
                        bodyweight squats to trying harder pistol squat progressions.
                    </p>

                    <p class="indent">
                        Really focus on consistency, having proper technique, gradual overload, and having control throughout the whole movement range of an exercise.
                        Mastery of the fundamentals unlocks advanced skills like handstands, muscle ups, front levers, and planches. 
                        <br>
                        Most importantly it's crucial to start trying harder skills regardless of how silly you my think you look.
