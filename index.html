                    <h2>What is calisthenics?</h2>
                    <p class="indent">
                        Calisthenics is a form of strength training that uses bodyweight exercises 
                        to develop control, endurance, and mobility. Instead of relying on machines 
                        or heavy weights, you use body weighted movements like push ups, pull ups, dips, and squats to build strength and control over your body.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        The focus is not just about lifting heavier, it's about mastering your body. 
                        As you progress, you move into more advanced skills like handstands, muscle ups, 
                        and front levers that require coordination, balance, and total body tension.

                            It builds real world strength, improves your mobility, and best of all 
                            requires minimal equipment to get started. You don't even need a 
                            gym membership, just your body and maybe a pull up bar to get started.

                            Starting is simple. Focus on mastering the

                            These are the foundation movements for all future calisthenic progressions.

                        As you get stronger, increase reps, slow down the movement, add weight,
                        or progress to harder variations.
                        <br> 
                        The key here is consistency. Mastering the basics will help you build the foundational strength you need to
