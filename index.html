                    <h2>What is calisthenics?</h2>
                    <p class="indent">
                        Calisthenics is a form of strength training that uses bodyweight exercises 
                        to develop control, endurance, and mobility. Instead of relying on machines 
                        or heavy weights, you use body weighted movements like push ups, pull ups, dips, and squats to build strength.
                    </p>

                    <p class="indent">
                        The focus is not just about lifting heavier, it's about mastering your body. 
                        As you progress, you move into more advanced skills like handstands, muscle-ups, 
                        and levers that require coordination, balance, and total body tension.

                    <h2>Why even bother training calisthenics?</h2>
                    <p class="indent">
                        It builds real-world strength, improves your mobility, and best of all 
                        requires minimal equipment to get started. You don't even need a 
                        gym membership, just your body and maybe a pull-up bar to get started.

                        <li><strong>Functional strength:</strong> You train movements, not machines.</li>
                        <li><strong>Joint health:</strong> Full range-of-motion exercises improve flexibility and control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalable difficulty:</strong> Every movement has easier and harder variations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Train anywhere:</strong> Home, park, gym — it doesn't matter.</li>

                    <h2>How to get started</h2>
                     <p class="indent">
                        Starting is simple. Focus on mastering the 
                        <a href="fundamentals.html"><strong>fundamental movement patterns</strong></a> first.
                        These are the foundation movements for all future calisthenic progressions.
                    </p>

                    <ul class="indent">
                        <li><strong>Push:</strong> Push ups and dips</li>
                        <li><strong>Pull:</strong> Pull ups and bodyweight rows</li>
                        <li><strong>Legs:</strong> Squats and lunges</li>
                        <li><strong>Core:</strong> Ab routines</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="indent">
                        If you're unsure how to structure these movements properly, 
                        check out the <a href="fundamentals.html">Calisthenics Fundamentals Page</a> 
                        where each pattern is explained in detail.
                    </p>

                    <p class="indent">
                        Begin with 3 to 4 workouts per week. Keep your sessions simple:
                    </p>

                    <ol class="indent">
                        <li>Warm up (5-10 minutes of light movement and mobility)</li>
                        <li>Pick 4-5 exercises</li>
                        <li>Do 3 sets of each</li>
                        <li>Focus on clean form over high reps</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        As you get stronger, increase reps, slow down the movement, 
                        or progress to harder variations. 
                        <br> 
                        The key here is consistency. Mastering the basics first before trying harder progressions and variatons.
